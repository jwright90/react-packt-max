## Notes @ 1st Sep 21
* React - Written in declarative language (unlikely just JS which is imperative)
* A component in React is just a function.
* Reach 'Passing Data via "Props"' @ 13:35
* Learned how constants defined within a React function can be re-used in the JSX (HTML-like) code using curly braces.

### Props
* Data is received into the component from outside of the function.
